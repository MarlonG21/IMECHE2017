use bumpers to get the elapsed time in which the motors are working.Set the motors to drive in the opposite direction with the same elasped time


align the robot;
Set_speed=1;
get_State of bumper switches
get alasped time for when the robot starts and when the bump switches are on.
Current_Direction.
